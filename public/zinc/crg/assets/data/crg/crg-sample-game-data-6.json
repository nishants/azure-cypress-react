For others they sail forever on the horizon, never out of sight, never landing until the watcher turn his eyes away in resignation, his dreams mocked to death by time. That is the life of men. \n Now, women forget all those things they don't  want to remember, and remember everything they don't want to forget. The dream is the truth. Then they act and do things accordingly."

My favorite book right now is The Fire Next Time by James Baldwin, but, in general, reading makes me smarter, helps me understand more about the world and other people and opens up tons of opportunities in life. But, here at Zinc, we realize a lot of people—maybe even most people—don’t enjoy reading. For us, that’s like saying you don’t enjoy eating! But, if you couldn’t taste the food and got no nutritional value from it, of course you wouldn’t enjoy it! So our mission here is to help you not only understand what a text says, but also appreciate HOW the writer put the text together, so you can experience more success at advanced reading and get more out of it if you’re already successful. Check it out!"

Video puts images directly into our brains through our eyes. But when we read, there’s an extra step. Our brains turn the letters, words and sentences into pictures and meanings. We call that ZINCING—ZINCING is when the words turn into meanings in your head. The process of Zincing—or turning great writing into images and meanings in the brain—FEELS GOOD. If you’re NOT Zincing, the text might as well be a solid rock wall. When that happens, finding words you can picture is like finding handholds that let you climb the wall."

They say something—often something you don’t fully understand—and then they explain by adding details, giving examples or about a million other things that help you get what they mean. Punctuation, like commas, dashes, semicolons or even periods, often show up right before an explanation or clarification. But sometimes an author will just drop an explanation in with no notice. In order to understand, connect the explanation back to the word or phrase."
