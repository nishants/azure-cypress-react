For others they sail forever on the horizon, never out of sight, never landing until the Watcher turns his eyes away in resignation, his dreams mocked to death by Time. That is the life of men. \n Now, women forget all those things they don't  want to remember, and remember everything they don't want to forget. The dream is the truth. Then they act and do things accordingly."

Video puts images directly into our brains through our eyes. But when we read, there’s an extra step. Our brains turn the letters, words and sentences into pictures and meanings. We call that ZINCING—ZINCING is when the words turn into meanings in your head. The process of Zincing—or turning great writing into images and meanings in the brain—FEELS GOOD. If you’re NOT Zincing, the text might as well be a solid rock wall. When that happens, finding words you can picture is like finding handholds that let you climb the wall."

She could’ve said, “Trucks on the highway have every man’s wish” or “seeds in the ground.” If she’d said “trucks,” that image would make me think of diesel fumes and heat and highway rest stops.
